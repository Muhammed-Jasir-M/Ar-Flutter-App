class ADescriptions {
  static const alien =
      'A hypothetical extraterrestrial life form, often depicted in popular culture with large eyes, gray skin, and advanced technology. While no scientific evidence exists, NASA continues searching for microbial life in our solar system through missions like Mars rovers and Europa Clipper.';

  static const sun =
      'The Sun is a 4.6-billion-year-old yellow dwarf star comprising 99.86% of our solar system\'s mass. Its core reaches 15 millionÂ°C through nuclear fusion, converting 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium every second. Solar winds travel at 800 km/s, creating the heliosphere that protects planets from interstellar radiation.';

  static const moon =
      'Earth\'s only natural satellite, with a diameter of 3,474 km (27% of Earth\'s). Its surface features include maria (ancient lava plains), highlands, and impact craters. The Moon stabilizes Earth\'s axial tilt, creating stable seasons, and causes tidal forces that slow Earth\'s rotation by 1.5 milliseconds per century.';

  static const pluto =
      'Dwarf planet in Kuiper Belt with a 2,377 km diameter. New Horizons revealed heart-shaped glacier (Sputnik Planitia) and blue atmospheric haze from tholins. Has 5 moons, including Charon (1,212 km diameter) forming a binary system.';

  static const ceres =
      'Largest object in asteroid belt (940 km diameter), containing 25% water ice. Dawn spacecraft detected organic molecules and bright salt deposits in Occator Crater. Considered a potential ocean world with subsurface brines.';

  static const skelton =
      'Human skeleton has 206 bones (270 at birth that fuse). Functions include support, movement, and hematopoiesis. Axial skeleton (80 bones) includes skull/vertebrae; appendicular (126) comprises limbs. Bones store calcium/phosphate and contain yellow (fat) or red (blood cells) marrow.';

  static const chicken =
      'Domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) descended from red junglefowl. Have 78 chromosomes (vs human 46) and 1,000+ breeds. Unique avian features include crop (food storage), gizzard (mechanical digestion), and preen gland for feather maintenance. Communicate through 24+ distinct vocalizations.';

  static const bed =
      'A piece of furniture used for sleeping or resting, typically consisting of a frame, mattress, and bedding. Beds come in various sizes (twin, queen, king) and styles (platform, bunk, canopy). Essential for comfort and support, they play a crucial role in sleep quality and overall health.';
